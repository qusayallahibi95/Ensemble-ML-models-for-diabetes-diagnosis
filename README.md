# Ensemble-ML-models-for-diabetes-diagnosis
In this work we build diabetes prediction system based on three stage: First stage, Data preprocessing that include(Fill the missing values, Handling the Outliers, Data Balancing, Data Normalization, Feature Selection). Second stage, Hyperparameters Tuning using Grid Search. Third stage,  combining individual ML techniques through Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking)

# Techniques Used: 

# Data Pre-processing:
Outliers Detection by using the interquartile range (IQR)
Data Balancing by using SMOTE method
Data normalization by using Min-Max normalization method
Feature Selection by using RFE technique 

# Tuning The Hyperparameters of ML Algorithms by using  Grid Search technique

# Individual ML techniques:
DT
LR
SVM
KNN
MLP

# Ensemble ML methods
Bagging
Boosting
Stacking
